          Made with WebAssebmly is an Open Source showcase of awesome production
          applications, side projects, and use cases made with WebAssembly (

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          After several Twitter threads (

          , ...) on highlighting use cases, projects, and companies in
          production using WebAssembly. Myself and a few other Wasm communitty
          members thought it'd be a great idea to have a dedicated place to find
          projects using WebAssembly, and highlight what WebAssembly can be used
          for! We were hoping it could be easy to comb through, and provide
          additional context on why/how individual project are using Wasm. üëçüèæ

        <h2>When should I generally use WebAssembly?</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite answer to this question is from the{" "}
          <a href="https://docs.assemblyscript.org/faq#is-webassembly-always-faster">
            AssemblyScript Documentation
          </a>
          . I'd like to provide one that is along the same lines, but remember,{" "}
          <i>
            this is a generalization and contains some metaphors. This section,
            and by looking through the projects on Made With WebAssembly can
            help you make a decision for your use case
          </i>
          .
          <br />
          <br />A good rule of thumb is:{" "}
          <b>
            Use WebAssembly for computationally intensive tasks, such as games,
            image manipulation, math, physics, audio effects, etc...
          </b>
          .
          <br />
          <br />
          You still generally want to use Javascript for a lot of things on the
          web. Such as Dom Manipulation (modifying/building views and UIs),
          blogs, ecommerce websites, using most Web APIs, etc...
          <br />
          <br />
          I like to think about WebAssembly being another tool in a developer's
          toolbelt. For example, a web developer's tools are HTML (Declaring
          UI), CSS (Styling UI), JavaScript (Adding functionality to a UI), and
          now WebAssembly (Processing heavy tasks, to give results back to the
          UI)! In which using the "right tool for the job" is what will give you
          the best results for your project, and help it be the best it can be!
