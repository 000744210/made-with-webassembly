Command Keen is an old school PC platformer by id software. Ported to the web with WebAssembly and Emscripten.

This project uses WebAssembly as it ports the Source code of Commander Keen, using Emscripten. This is quite notable, as it proves that WebAssembly can bring these large C/C++ codebases using Emscripten to the web, to run impressive 3d, and old school games on the web.
