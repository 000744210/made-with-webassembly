GDevelop is an open-source, cross-platform game engine designed to be used by everyone.

GDevelop uses emscripten to port pieces from the old native application for Gdevelop, to the web! This is quite notable, as it proves that WebAssembly can bring these large C/C++ codebases using Emscripten to the web, to run impressive 3d graphics. And also, porting these apps preserve a good, performant user experience, but allows them to take advantage of the portability of the web!

If you are interested in porting C/C++ libraries, I'd highly reccomend [Ben Smith's (binji) SFHTML5 Talk](https://youtu.be/FQJrcX4Ae8A) on porting C projects to the web. This talk is unrealted to Google Earth, but can help drive what goes into porting these types of applications.
