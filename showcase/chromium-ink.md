Ink uses webassembly, and webassembly threads, to bring a super fast and performant experiene for users. The app has been praised for it's extremely good performance and user experience, even on low powered devices like chrome books. This is because WebAssembly is great for computationally intensive tasks, like in this case of handling realtime-input to do graphics work.
