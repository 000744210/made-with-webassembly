Arxwasm is an experimental port of the [Arx Libertatis](http://arx-libertatis.org/) project to WebAssembly using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/), allowing to run the [Arx Fatalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arx_Fatalis) video game (2002) in modern Web Browsers.

This project uses WebAssembly as it ports the GPL Licensed Source code of the demo, using Emscripten. This is quite notable, as it proves that WebAssembly can bring these large C/C++ codebases using Emscripten to the web, to run impressive 3d games.

If you are interested in porting C/C++ libraries or applications, I'd highly reccomend [Ben Smith's (binji) SFHTML5 Talk](https://youtu.be/FQJrcX4Ae8A) on porting C projects to the web. This talk is unrealted to D3Wasm, but can help drive what goes into porting these types of applications.
