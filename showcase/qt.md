QT Uses WebAssembly as it runs it's business logic in WebAssembly, and then runs all UI and DOM Access by calling out to JavaScript. This is super exciting, as many small and large C applications use QT as their graphics library, which highlights WebAssemblys portability! As it shows that small projects can now easily have a web target avilable for them to bring their apps to the web in a language they are comfortable with!
