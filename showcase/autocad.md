AutoCAD is a design tool for creating 2D and 3D drawings.

The AutoCAD web app uses emscripten to port pieces from the > 35 years old native application for AutoCAD, to the web! This is quite notable, as it proves that WebAssembly can bring these large C/C++ codebases using Emscripten to the web, to run large computationally intensive desktop applications on the web!

If you are interested in porting C/C++ libraries, I'd highly reccomend [Ben Smith's (binji) SFHTML5 Talk](https://youtu.be/FQJrcX4Ae8A) on porting C projects to the web. This talk is unrealted to Google Earth, but can help drive what goes into porting these types of applications.
