Amped Studio uses WebAssembly, as Digital Audio Workstations do a ton of heavy compuation of math and alrogithms to add sound waves to then create a final sound. Thus, the actual logic of adding effects, samples, generating sounds, etc.. is done using WebAssembly. This is exciting, as the performance benefits of WebAssembly relative to having to write Web Apps in Javascript, means that a **whole new class of Web Applications can now be accomplished on the web**! Historically Native Desktop apps, like Digital Audio Workstations, can now be brought to the web with a usable and delightful user experience!
