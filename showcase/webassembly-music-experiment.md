WebAssembly Music Experiment by Peter Salomonsen, is a web music livecoding editor, in which the instruments are implemented in AssemblyScript.

WebAssembly Music Experiment by Peter Salomonsen, uses AssemblyScript to develop the logic and sample output of each of the available instruments in the livecoding editor. As they state in their article listed below: "WebAssembly makes it possible to synthesize audio in real time with consistent / predictable performance." Meaning, due to the computationally demainding task of syntehsizing audio, JavaScript had a hard time doing this task, but it makes it a perfect fit for WebAssembly. Thus, unlocking new, high-performance functionality, for the browser!
