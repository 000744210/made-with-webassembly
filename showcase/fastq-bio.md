fastq.bio, an interactive genomics web tool for analyzing genmoics data.

![Fastq dot bio ScreenShot](/assets/showcase-assets/fastq-bio.jpg)

fastq.bio uses WebAssembly, as the current implementation had a re-write of a C library in JavaScript so that it may run in the browser. However, this leads to many errors and a huge developement cost. With WebAssembly they were able to port the industry standard C Library to WebAssembly, to then be run in the browser. Not only did this lead to greater accuracy, however, it lead to a 10X speed up and better user experience for the analysis tool!

The talk listed in the additional resources is highly reccomended!
