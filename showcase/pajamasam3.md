This project uses WebAssembly as it ports the Source code of the ShareWare demo of Pajama Sam 3, using Emscripten. This is quite notable, as it proves that WebAssembly can bring these large C/C++ codebases using Emscripten to the web, to run impressive games.

If you are interested in porting C/C++ libraries or applications, I'd highly reccomend [Ben Smith's (binji) SFHTML5 Talk](https://youtu.be/FQJrcX4Ae8A) on porting C projects to the web. This talk is unrealted to D3Wasm, but can help drive what goes into porting these types of applications.
