Lucet is a native WebAssembly compiler and runtime. It is designed to safely execute untrusted WebAssembly programs inside your application. Uses [Cranelift](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cranelift) for it's WebAssembly execution.

Server side runtimes for WebAssembly highlight the portability of WebAssembly. WebAssembly provides a compile target for multiple languages to be used in many different contexts. This also allows for some level of containerization of your application or library, due to the sandboxed nature of WebAssembly's linear memory, and Capability-based security model.

Lucet is a project under the Bytecode Alliance, an industry partnership coming together to forge WebAssemblyâ€™s outside-the-browser future by collaborating on implementing standards and proposing new ones.
