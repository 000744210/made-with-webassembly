Blazor allows developers to build client web apps with C#, powered by WebAssembly.

Blazor uses WebAssembly to allow for running .NET on the Web. This shows another key feature of WebAssembly, which is it's portability. Allowing code of different languages to be run in more places (such as the web browser!). All DOM interaction is done with glue code using JavaScript. WebAssembly is used to bootstrap the .NET runtime, and run the .NET assemblies!
