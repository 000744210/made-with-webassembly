Ableton Learning Synths is an interactive website to learn the fundamentals of synthesis.

Ableton uses WebAssembly, as generating audio from synthesis does a ton of heavy compuation of math and alrogithms to add sound waves to then create a final sound is done using WebAssembly. This is exciting, as the performance benefits of WebAssembly relative to having to write Web Apps in Javascript, means that a **whole new class of Web Applications can now be accomplished on the web**! Historically native desktop apps, like Digital Audio Workstations, can now be brought to the web with a usable and delightful user experience!
