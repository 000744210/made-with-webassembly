# WasmByExample

Wasm By Example is a website containing simple examples for how to get things done with wasm.

This project is heavily inspired by [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/). Wasm is still relatively young, and I thought it would be great to have a similar, hands-on / tutorial / introduction into WebAssembly for those who "learn by doing". If you are just getting started with WebAssembly, this is a great place to start!
