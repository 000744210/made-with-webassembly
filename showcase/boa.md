Boa was written for the other advantages of rust, such as memory safety. However,due to Rust having amazing tooling and support for WebAssembly. It was brought to the web. This highlights that WebAssembly allows for the portability to bring projects, both large and small, to the web. Thus, you get all the advantages of the web, such as linking. Also, JavaScript engines running in WebAssembly, have the advantage of being able to run untrusted JS code, as it is sandboxed within the WebAssembly runtime.
