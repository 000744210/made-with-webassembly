Nox was ported for web browsers, including Multiplayer using [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)!

This project uses WebAssembly as it ports the Source code of Nox, using Emscripten. This is quite notable, as it proves that WebAssembly can bring these large C/C++ codebases using Emscripten to the web, to run impressive 3d games.

If you are interested in porting C/C++ libraries or applications, I'd highly reccomend [Ben Smith's (binji) SFHTML5 Talk](https://youtu.be/FQJrcX4Ae8A) on porting C projects to the web. This talk is unrealted to D3Wasm, but can help drive what goes into porting these types of applications.
